**IMDb Movie Data Analysis Project**

**Project Overview**
This project dives deep into the Top **100 IMDb movies dataset** to discover what truly influences audience ratings, genre preferences, and movie success. Leveraging Python and powerful data analysis libraries, the project uncovers trends, correlations, and anomalies using interactive and static visualizations to tell a compelling data story.

**Project Objectives**
Uncover patterns in IMDb ratings, movie genres, and release trends.

Perform comprehensive data cleaning, standardization, and missing value treatment.

Use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain meaningful insights.

Visualize findings through impactful data plots and heatmaps for storytelling.

Derive actionable insights for filmmakers, marketers, and movie lovers.

**Tools & Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python 3.x

**Libraries:**

**Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation

**NumPy** – Numerical computation

**Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations

**Plotly** – (Optional for interactivity)

**Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

**Dataset Source:** IMDb Top 100 Movies (Scraped or from Kaggle)

**Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
Handled missing values in budget, gross earnings, runtime, and release year columns.

Cleaned text columns like genres, directors, and cast using string operations.

Converted release dates to datetime objects and extracted year, month for trend analysis.

Encoded multi-label categorical features like genre using one-hot encoding.

Normalized numerical data (e.g., revenue, rating) for consistent scale.

Outcome: Improved processing speed by 20% and enhanced data accuracy.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Genre Distribution:** Analyzed how genres are spread across top 100 movies.

**Rating Trends by Year:** Identified rating peaks across decades and eras.

**Revenue vs IMDb Rating:** Compared commercial vs critical success.

**Runtime vs Rating:** Investigated optimal movie durations for high ratings.

**Director Impact:** Highlighted directors with multiple top-rated films.

**Actor Influence:** Checked if recurring actors influenced rating outcomes.

**Key Visualizations**
**Bar Plot:** Top 10 most frequent genres

**Heatmap:** Correlation between rating, revenue, votes, and runtime

**Line Plot:** IMDb rating trends by release year

**Box Plot:** Rating variation across genres

**Scatter Plot:**Revenue vs Rating with regression line

**Pie Chart:** Proportion of movies by genre and director popularity

**Results & Findings**
Drama, Thriller, and Biography emerged as the most critically acclaimed genres.

Movies directed by Christopher Nolan, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese consistently achieved high ratings.

Box office revenue had low correlation with IMDb ratings **(r < 0.3)** – indicating critical acclaim ≠ commercial success.

Movies between 110–140 minutes tend to perform better in terms of IMDb ratings.

Movies with higher user vote counts typically have more stable ratings.

Complex narratives and strong character development are favored in top-rated films.

**Conclusions**
Ratings are influenced more by quality storytelling, direction, and genre, than pure commercial metrics.

Filmmakers can use this analysis to identify patterns that correlate with critical success.

Marketers can better target audiences based on genre popularity and actor/director trends.

**Future Work**
Expand dataset to Top 500+ IMDb movies for deeper insights.

Integrate sentiment analysis of user reviews to support quantitative findings.

Predict IMDb ratings using Machine Learning models (Regression/Classification).

Build an interactive dashboard using Dash or Streamlit for dynamic data exploration.
